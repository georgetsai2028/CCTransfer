        <p class = "story"> CC Transfer was created to help community college students navigate their transition to universities. 
            I personally struggled with the lack of clear transfer guidance and missed my chance at UCI due to one overlooked requirement. This site exists to ensure other students donâ€™t face the same obstacles
